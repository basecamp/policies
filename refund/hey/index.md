# A fair refund policy

With HEY, we sell subscriptions on an annual basis only. If you cancel HEY, we make sure you aren’t charged in the future but your service subscription will remain in place until the end of that paid year. That gives you time to migrate to a new provider, change any logins that use your HEY email address, etc.

You can also choose to completely close your account before your paid subscription runs out. That means all of your emails, etc. are inaccessible immediately, no turning back. If you do this, here are examples of refunds we’d grant:

- You decided HEY wasn’t for you and stopped using it early on but forgot to cancel your account. Then you got the auto-renewal invoice. If you don’t need any extra time to prep, let us know and we’ll refund that last payment.
- You decide HEY isn’t for you and you finish migrating out, changing logins, etc. well ahead of the end of your paid period. Let us know and we’ll refund back a prorated amount for the remaining whole months.
- If you were really not happy with HEY, you can have your money back.

We’ll also consider giving credits for future cycles if something goes wrong on our side. For example, if we had extended downtime (multiple hours in a day, or multiple days in a month) or you emailed customer service and it took multiple days to get back to you, we’ll issue a partial credit to your account.
