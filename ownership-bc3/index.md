# Who owns a Basecamp 4 account?

Basecamp 4 accounts are owned by individuals, not by organizations. When you sign up and create a [Basecamp account][home], you are the owner of that account and all the data in it. Our legal responsibility is to the account owner(s), so we won’t let other people take over your account without your permission.

## What can account owners do?

Account owners can:

- **Access and export all data in an account**: account owners can add themselves to any Team or Project and view everything in the account trash ([how-to](https://3.basecamp-help.com/article/100-owner-actions)). As an account owner, you can also create an HTML export of your Basecamp account data at any time ([how-to](https://3.basecamp-help.com/article/150-export-your-basecamp-data)). These exports function include everything already accessible to you in your Basecamp account. The exports do not include website interaction logs for any account users and we do not provide such meta-data to account owners. For more details, please read our [Privacy policy](../privacy/index.md), which outlines what meta-data we collect and for what purposes.
- **Manage all aspects of the account's subscription:** including updating billing information; adding more users and account administrators; and canceling an account ([how-to](https://3.basecamp-help.com/category/94-account-billing)).
- **Designate other account owners**: Basecamp 4 accounts can have [multiple owners][help-owners]. We recommend designating other owners you trust, so that updates can be made to the account when you're not available.

## Designating other people as owners

An account owner can add or remove other owners from the [Adminland][help-adminland] section in the account. When you designate someone else as an account owner, they will have the same power to add and remove other owners (including you) at any time.

Adding a new owner to the account (or being removed as an owner) does not remove the credit card from the account. [Please contact support][support] if you’d like to remove the card from the account before you add a new owner with the intent of being removed as an owner yourself.

## What happens when none of the current account owners are available?

It happens — people switch jobs, get laid off, go on extended leave — the account owner(s) may be unavailable for any number of reasons. Still, our obligation is to the current account owner(s). That means we’re unable to add new owners to the account without permission from a current account owner, communicated from the email address we have on file.

If the account has been frozen due to non-payment for less than a week, we’ll be glad to thaw the account for a week or so, so people can access their work in the meantime.

The quickest route to add a new owner is often to contact a current account owner, and ask them to log in and add another owner right away from the Adminland section.

Otherwise, we can also gladly reach out to any current account owners at the email addresses we have on file, and request permission to add an owner. If it’s a company address and another employee has access to the inbox, the person who receives the email can grant permission to add a new owner. For security’s sake, permission must come from an address we have on file for a current account owner.

When none of the above is an option, a court order is required to add another owner to the account. We will of course readily comply with any court orders to turn data over to the appropriate party.

## What if I have another question about ownership?

Basecamp may update this policy once in a blue moon — we’ll notify you about significant changes by emailing the account owner or by placing a prominent notice on our site. You can access, change or delete your personal information at any time by contacting Basecamp [support][support].
