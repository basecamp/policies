# Reacher subprocessors

We use third party subprocessors, such as cloud computing providers and customer support software, to run Reacher (the service). We establish GDPR-compliant data processing agreements with each subprocessor, extending [GDPR safeguards](../regulations/index.md) everywhere personal data is processed.

The following is a list of personal data subprocessors we use. These subprocessors are all located in the United States:

* [Saasify](https://saasify.sh/privacy). Account management services.
* [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/gdpr). Cloud services provider.
* [Stripe](https://stripe.com/fr/privacy). Payment processing services.
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/gdpr-ccpa/). Cloud hosting provider.
* [Sentry](https://blog.sentry.io/2018/03/14/gdpr-sentry-and-you). Error reporting software.
* [SimpleAnalytics](https://simpleanalytics.com/privacy). Analytics services.
* [Crisp Chat](https://crisp.chat/en/privacy/). Customer messaging platform.
