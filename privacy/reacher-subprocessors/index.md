# Basecamp subprocessors

We use third party subprocessors, such as cloud computing providers and customer support software, to run Basecamp (the service). We establish GDPR-compliant data processing agreements with each subprocessor, extending [GDPR safeguards](../regulations/index.md) everywhere personal data is processed.

The following is a list of personal data subprocessors we use. These subprocessors are all located in the United States:

* [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/gdpr-center/). Cloud services provider.
* [Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/legal/payment-services-agreement-us). Payment processing services.
* [Customer.io](https://customer.io/gdpr.html). Transactional email service.
* [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/security/gdpr/resource-center/). Cloud services provider.
* [Google reCAPTCHA](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/). Anti-bot protection.
* [Help Scout](https://www.helpscout.net/company/legal/gdpr/). Help desk software.
* [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/gdpr/). Transactional email service.
* [Sentry](https://blog.sentry.io/2018/03/14/gdpr-sentry-and-you). Error reporting software.
