# Campfire subprocessors

*Last updated: February 27, 2023*

We use third party subprocessors, such as cloud computing providers and customer support software, to run Campfire. We establish GDPR-compliant data processing agreements with each subprocessor, extending [GDPR safeguards](../index.md) everywhere personal data is processed.

The following is a list of personal data subprocessors we use. These subprocessors are all located in the United States:

* [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/gdpr-center/). Cloud services provider.
* [Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/legal/payment-services-agreement-us). Payment processing services.
* [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/gdpr/introduction/). Cloud services provider.
* [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/security/gdpr/resource-center/). Cloud services provider.
* [hCaptcha](https://hcaptcha.com/privacy). Anti-bot protection.
